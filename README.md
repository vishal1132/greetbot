# GreetBot
Greet bot is a bot(slack application) for slack workspace [ansh-org.slack.com] , which greets new users that join the workspace, with a custom message. Greetbot is written entirely in go as microservice architecture.

 - In a very initial phase now.
 - Few cool features can be expected.
 - But the domain will be specific to greeting new users.
 - There will be another general purpose bot.

The bot is deployed on heroku using continuous deployment. GithubActions used for continuous integration.

## Who am I?
- I am a software developer from India.
- Microservice architecture and distributed systems enthusiast.
- Automation enthusiast as well, because of microservices :laughing:. 
- Love coding in go.
- Want to build a community where people empower young developers.

## What is this workspace about?
  - It is in very initial stage right now, but trying to build a wide-range community.
  - There are 2 public channels right now, #general and #funny, because nobody wants to do work everytime.
